# Rental Property Calculator

## Description

Rental Property Calculator is a web app that is useful for analyzing rental properties for investing purposes. It allows you to see your properties value, cash flow, equity buildup, return on investment, return on equity, and cash on cash return for years during your mortgage and after the property is paid off.

The application has a login system to save and view your analysis in the future.

Eventually the calculator will also support exporting analyses in Excel and PDF formats and further flexibility in how the user can analyze their rental properties.
