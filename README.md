# Rental Property Calculator

## Description

This project is a work in progress and currently some features are incomplete.

Rental Property Calculator is an Electron app that is useful for analyzing rental properties for investing purposes. It allows you to see your properties value, cash flow, equity buildup, return on investment, return on equity, and cash on cash return for years during your mortgage and after the property is paid off.

Eventually the calculator will also support saving calculated properties, exporting them in Excel and PDF formats and further flexibility in how the user can analyze their rental properties.

The front end tech stack includes [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel).

Unit testing is done using [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).
